The purpose of this project is to re-design and develop IUPUI's Paws Pantry website.
Our goal is to create a simple yet elegant site that is easy for both users and admins to use.
Users will be able to navigate to this website to complete an Intake Form, and/or create, edit, or cancel their appointment. 
The Admin will be able to view, create, edit, or delete appointments as needed.
