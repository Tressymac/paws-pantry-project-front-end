The purpose of this project is to re-design and develop IUPUI's Paws Pantry website.
Our goal is to create a simple yet elegant site that is easy for both users and admins to use.
User's will be able to navigate to this website to create an account, login, and/or schedule an appointment with Paws Pantry. 
The Admin will be able to view, create, edit, or delete meetings as needed.
